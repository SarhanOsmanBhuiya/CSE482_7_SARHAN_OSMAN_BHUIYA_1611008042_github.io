		<b>Class Attendance: </b> Attendance is mandatory for lab classes. Attendance will be taken at the beginning of the class. If you enter the class 10 minutes late, you will get a late attendance. If you come to the class 30 minutes late you will be considered as absent. Two late attendances equal to one absent. <br><br> 

		<b>Exams and Quizzes:  </b>  Exams and quizzes will be closed book and closed notes. No electronic devices except non-programmable calculators will be allowed during exams. Calculators cannot be shared with friends. Nobody will be allowed to go outside the exam hall. There will be no makeup quizzes.  <br><br> 

		<b>Lab Report:  </b>You have to submit Lab reports at the beginning of the class when it is due. If you miss this deadline, your points will be reduced by 40% for next day submission. If you miss the next day’s deadline, your will get zero credit for that Lab report. All the Lab reports should be done and submitted individually. You may take guidance from your friend but are not allowed to copy lab reports especially the discussion part.  <br><br> 

		<b>Class Etiquette:  </b> Distracting others in lab class is violating others rights to be attentive. So, laptop or cell phones cannot be turned on during class time. Group discussion is encouraged and personal discussion is discouraged during class time.  <br><br> 

		<b>General Course Administration: </b>  I’ll provide the lab manual and you’ll have to complete the given tasks during the class time. Last 30 minutes of the class is fixed for checking and grading. I’ll explain the problems at the beginning of the class and you can ask me at any point of the class, if you need any additional information.  <br><br> 

		<b>Academic Honesty:  </b> Any means of unauthorized assistance in preparing materials which a student submits as original work is deemed to be cheating. Any kind of cheating or plagiarism will make your obtained marks zero for that report, assignment, quiz or exam. Both who copied and who let others copy will be treated as same, meaning both will get zero for that report, assignment, quiz or exam.  <br><br> 

			<b class="ab">** If you fail to get 60% marks (12 out of 20) in the lab, you will also get a F in the course ** </b>
