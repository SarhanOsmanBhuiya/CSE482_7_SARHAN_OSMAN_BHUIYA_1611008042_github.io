			What is CSS?
		</h2>
			<p>
				Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to
				simplify the process of making web pages presentable. <br> <br>
				CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the
				text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out,
				what background images or colors are used, as well as a variety of other effects. <br> <br>
				CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides a powerful control over the presentation
				of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML
				or XHTML.

			Advantages of CSS
		</h2>
			<p>
				You should be familiar with:
				<ul>
				  <li><b>CSS saves time -</b> You can write CSS once 	and then reuse the same sheet in multiple
					HTML pages. You can define a style for each HTML element and apply it to as many
					web pages as you want.</li>
				  <li><b>Pages load faster -</b> If you are using 		CSS, you do not need to write HTML tag
					attributes every time. Just write one CSS rule of a tag and apply it to all the
					occurrences of that tag. So, less code means faster download times.</li>
				  <li><b>Easy maintenance -</b> To make a global change, simply change the style, and all the
					elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically.</li>
				  <li><b>Superior styles to HTML -</b> CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so
					you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.</li>
				  <li><b>Multiple Device Compatibility -</b> Style sheets allow content to be optimized for more
					than one type of device. By using the same HTML document, different versions of a
					website can be presented for handheld devices such as PDAs and cellphones or for
					printing.</li>
					<li><b>Global web standards –</b> Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it is being
					recommended to use CSS. So it’s a good idea to start using CSS in all the HTML pages
					to make them compatible with future browsers.</li>
				</ul>  
			</p>
			<br><br>
			<h2 class="bod">
			Who Creates and Maintains CSS?
			</h2>
				<p>
					CSS is created and maintained through a group of people within the W3C called the CSS
					Working Group. The CSS Working Group creates documents called specifications. When a
					specification has been discussed and officially ratified by the W3C members, it becomes a
					recommendation. 	<br> <br>
					These ratified specifications are called recommendations because the W3C has no control over
					the actual implementation of the language. Independent companies and organizations create
					that software. <br> <br>
					NOTE: The World Wide Web Consortium or W3C is a group that makes recommendations
					about how the Internet works and how it should evolve.
									</p>
				<br><br>
				<h2 class="bod">
				CSS Versions
				</h2>
					<p>
						Cascading Style Sheets level 1 (CSS1) came out of W3C as a recommendation in December
						1996. This version describes the CSS language as well as a simple visual formatting model
						for all the HTML tags. <br> <br>
						CSS2 became a W3C recommendation in May 1998 and builds on CSS1. This version adds
						support for media-specific style sheets e.g. printers and aural devices, downloadable fonts,
						element positioning and tables.
